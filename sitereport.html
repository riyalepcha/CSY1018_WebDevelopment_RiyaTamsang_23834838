        <h2> Experience and Learning Web Development</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Riya Tamsang. I'm writing today to share my experience gaining a foundational understanding of web development, code, design, and the debugging process. To begin with, Web development is the process of creating websites for the internet, which includes code and markup. Students find web development to be a highly engaging and familiar subject. A portfolio website including a home page, contact page, portfolio page, work experience page, and site report was the goal of our task. We had never created a portfolio site before, so it was really new to us. We are becoming more accustomed to website coding and design. In this subject, we learned how to use HTML and CSS to build and design websites. We had a great time and got a chance to learn and explore new things.</p>
