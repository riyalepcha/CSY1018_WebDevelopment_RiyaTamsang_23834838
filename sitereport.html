        <h2> Experience and Learning Web Development</h2>
        <p>Since starting the journey of web development, It had many ups and downs. At first, I was overwhelmed with the amount of information and skills I needed to learn. However, with consistent practice and dedication, I started to make progress.</p>
        <p>One of my biggest challenges was learning CSS. It was difficult to understand at first, but after reading articles and watching tutorials, I started to get the hang of it. I also struggled with debugging my code and fixing errors, but I found that using developer tools and asking for help from online communities made a big difference.
        Overall, I'm proud of the progress I've made in web development. I've learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and I've created a portfolio site that showcases my skills. I have decited to continue learning and growing in this field, and I'm excited to see where my journey takes me.</p>
